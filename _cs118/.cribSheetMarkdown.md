## Number systems

### Two's complement

- In order to store negative integer numbers, we don't just add a "sign bit" as we would normally, as then we define both positive and negative values for zero, which wastes space, and can be confusing. Instead, we use "two's complement"
  - Binary representation, but the left-most bit is negative
    ![twosComplement](..\media\twosComplement.png)
  - With eight bits, the smallest value is $10000000_2 = -128_{10}$, and the largest value is $01111111_2 = 127_{10}$ (this is $-2^n $ to $2^n - 1$)

### IEEE-754 floating point

- In order to store decimal numbers, we use "floating point notation", which automatically handles the trade-off between precision and range for storing numbers in a fixed number of bits. This is defined in the IEEE-754 specification ([source](https://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_isoiecfdis60559%7Bed2.0%7Den.pdf)), and explained further [here](https://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html)
- A tool for checking this is [available](https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html)
- For single precision `floats` (`double`s use different sized exponents and mantissas, but operate in the same way) the schema for the number is:
  ![IEEE754main](..\media\IEEE754main.png)
  - The "sign bit" denotes whether the number is positive or negative
  - The "exponent" needs to represent both positive and negative numbers, but it **does not** use two's complement, it instead uses a bias of $127$, meaning you subtract $-127$ from the decimal value to get the exponent. Additionally, $-127_{10} = 00000000_2$ and $128+{10} = 11111111_2$ are reserved special cases. Double precision uses an 11-bit field instead of an 8-bit one, and hence has an offset of $1023$
  - The "fraction/mantissa" represents the precision bits of the number, with the most significant bit being $\frac{1}{2^1}$, then $\frac{1}{2^2}$, and so on. This is taken as the value after the binary point, and in almost all cases, the value before the binary point is one, however, if the exponent is all $0$s, it is $0$ and said to be denormalised. Double precision uses a 52-bit field instead of a 23-bit one.
    As a rule of thumb, calculate the value of the fraction from binary with the reciprocal values, the add one to it
  - The fraction represents the value of the number, and is of fixed precision, for example, 23 bits of information. The exponent then specifies the range of the number.
  - Special values
    - Denormalised, when the exponent is all $0$s, so the number is assumed to have a leading $0$ not a leading $1$ before the binary point, i.e. $0.[fraction]$ not $ 1.[fraction]$
    - Zero, when both the exponent and fraction are all $0$s, so it resolves to $0.0$ . Due to the sign bit, there are both positive and negative zeroes, but they compare as equal
    - Infinity, positive and negative infinities are when the exponent is all $1$s, but the fraction is all $0$s, and the sign bit indicates sign. Since they are actual values in the scheme, we can do operations on them
    - NaN (not a number), when the exponent is all $1$s, and there is a non-zero fraction. These can be used for signalling errors etc.
- An example of this in practice is:
  ![IEEE754example](..\media\IEEE754example.png)
  Note that the "1.(fraction)" denotes a decimal point, not a multiplication operation





## Data types

### Primitive data types

| Name      | Range                                                        | Size    | Default  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `true` or `false`                                            | 1 bit   | `false`  |
| `byte`    | $-128$ to $127$                                              | 1 byte  | `0`      |
| `short`   | $-32768$ to $+32767$                                         | 2 bytes | `0`      |
| `char`    | $0$ to $65,535$                                              | 2 bytes | `\u0000` |
| `int`     | $-2,147,483,648$ to $+2,147,483,647$                         | 4 bytes | `0`      |
| `long`    | $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63}-1$                                      | 8 bytes | `0L`     |
| `float`   | $-3.4 \times 10^{38}$ and $3.4 \times 10^{38}$ with 6 to 7 significant digits of accuracy | 4 bytes | `0.0f`   |
| `double`  | $-1.7 \times 10^{308}$ and $1.7 \times 10^{308}$ with 14 to 15 significant digits of accuracy | 8 bytes | `0.0d`   |

The `char` primitive is essentially an unsigned `short` primitive, which is used to store UTF-16 encoded single characters instead of a number

### Passing by reference and by value

- Primitive data types are stored as a value in a place in memory, for example, and `int` would be four consecutive bytes, whose value can be looked up by a variable name
- However, since objects are not necessarily of a fixed size, we cannot just allocate an amount of memory for them. Instead, we store a "reference" to them on the heap, and the variable name refers to this reference, not the actual data
  - Because of this, we cannot use the `==` operator to compare object contents, as it merely compares their memory references, only telling you if it is the exact same instance, not if it has the same stuff in
- All parameters passed to and returned by methods are "passed-by-value", i.e. the data in the physical memory space is duplicated in the scope of the method, and won't affect the contents of the variable which it was passed from. However, we know that objects are only stored as references to the data on the heap, so the value passed is only the reference to the data, so it any operations will act on the same object, so it becomes "pass-by-reference", as it is passing the value of the reference to the object
  - In practice, in Java primitives are "pass-by-value" (so changing them in the method won't change them outside it), and objects are "pass-by-reference" (so any changes to them in a new method will affect their state outside of it)
- Autoboxing is an action performed automatically by the compiler, which "boxes" a primitive into its corresponding object (e.g. `int` to `Integer`) if a method requires an object, not just a primitive value.

### Casting

- Casting is the process of changing the data type used to express a piece of information, for example to change the range or the precision used to store a numeric value

- There are three different sets of keywords used to describe casting, which are:

  - Explicit and implicit

    - Explicit casting is when the casting is indicated directly in the source code. In Java, this is denoted by wrapping the new type in brackets, for example `castValue = (newType) value`
    - Implicit casting is when the casting can be inferred by the compiler, and so does not need to be indicated directly in the source code (however, it can be indicated with explicit casting as well for easier readability)

  - Safe/widening and unsafe/narrowing casting

    - Safe (also called widening) casting is when the value is moved to a data type which supports more precision or a greater range of values. **No data is lost in this operation**. This can be done simply by setting a more precisely/larger typed variable equal to the value of a less precisely/smaller typed one, using implicit casting

      ```java
      float narrowValue = 3.141f;
      double widenedValue = narrrowValue;
      ```

      Explicit casting can also be used, although it is not necessary, for additional readability

    - Unsafe (also called narrowing) casting is when the value is moved to a data type which supports less precision or a smaller range of values. **Data can (possibly but not necessarily) be lost in this operation**. This must be indicated with an explicit cast, with brackets indicating the new type, as the compiler cannot infer that the type should change
  
        ```java
        float wideValue = 3.141f;
      int narrowedValue = (int) wideValue;
      ```
    
      Explicit casting is required for unsafe casting, but unsafe casting is not required for explicit casting
  
  - Checked and unchecked casting
  
    - Checked casting is when the cast operation is "well-defined", i.e. the output type is able to represent the information stored in the input type. For example, numeric types can be safely cast between each other, since they all encode numbers
  
    - Unchecked casting is when the cast operation is may not be "well-defined", i.e. the output type may not be able to represent all the information stored in the input type, or the input type may not provide enough information to "fill" the output type. For example, casting from an `ArithmeticException` to an `Integer` would be an unsafe cast, as one cannot fully represent the other.
  
      Unsafe/unchecked casting will result in an error being thrown by the compiler, unless the `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` method annotation is used, which allows the code to be compiled, but this may still fail at runtime





## Operator evaluation and precedence

- Lazy and strict operators
  - Lazy operators aren't executed if an earlier operations fully defines the statement, e.g. in an "or" operation, if the first statement is true, the second statement needn't be tested
  - Strict operators execute everything, even if it isn't "needed" to ascertain the logical value of the statement, as state might be mutated in later parts, e.g. `y & (x++ == 4)` would change the value of `x`
  
- Pre-increment and post-increment
  
  - `++i` increments the variable before it is used in an expression (incremented then returned), whereas `i++` increments it after it has been used (returned then incremented). This can affect the output of some expressions
  
- Operator precedence ([additional source](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~willb/cs302/java-operator-precedence.pdf))

  | Letter | Name             | Operations             |
  | ------ | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
  | P      | Postfix          | `expr++`, `expr--`     |
  | U      | Unary/Prefix     | `++expr`, `--expr`     |
  | M      | Multiplicative   | `*`, `/`, `&`          |
  | A      | Additive         | `+`, `-`               |
  | S      | Shift            | `>>`,`<<`              |
  | R      | Relational       | `>`,`<`,`<=`,`>=`      |
  | E      | Equality         | `==`,`!=`              |
  | S      | Strict operators | `&`,`|`,`^`            |
  | L      | Lazy operators   | `&&`,`||`              |
  | A      | Assignment       | `=`,`+=`,`-=`,`*=`,... |



## Conditionals

### The switch statement

- `Switch` statements offer a way to select control flow based off the value of a variable as opposed to a boolean condition. In some cases, this can be more simple, and hence preferred over `if` statements

- ```java
  switch (variable) {
          case value_1:
              //If the variable is equal to value_1, execute the code, then exit the statement due to the break statement
              break;
          case value_2:
              //If the variable is not equal to value_1, and is equal to value_2 then execute the code, and continue executing each block until the next break statement occurs, or the statement ends
          case value_3:
              //If the variable is not equal to value_1, and is equal to either value_2 (since it is running through with no break statement) or value_3, then execute the code, then exit the statement due to the break statement
          	break;
          default:
          	//If no cases have been satisfied, or the code runs through due to no break statements, execute the code
  }
  ```

- Both the `break` and `default` sections are optional

- Objects should not be switched on, only primitives, as the equality will compare their memory reference with the `==` operator, rather than calling the `.equals()` function.

- We can reason carefully about what happens in conditionals by writing out the preconditions (similar idea to the explanation above, but easier to do it in boolean expressions to be terse)

- Switch statements are faster than `if..else if.. else` statements when there are a large number of cases, as lookup tables can be used, which are fast



## Object oriented programming

### Pillars of object oriented programming

There is some argument over the number of "pillars", but the four commonly accepted ones are:

- Abstraction
  - "Exposing essential features, whilst hiding irrelevant detail" 
  
  - Used so that the purpose/interface of a function can be separated from its implementation, making code re-usable, more understandable, and easier to modify (won't break things, changes need to be made in fewer places)
    
    
  
- Encapsulation
  - "Bundling data and operations that can be performed on that data together - leads to data hiding"
    - Encapsulation is not data hiding, but it does lead to it
    - Making state variables `private` and the methods that act on them `public` is called data hiding
    
  - "Wrapping data and the code acting on it together as a single unit", so users must use the external interface, rather than just changing things internally.
  
  - "The action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule", so that an object controls its own internal state, and should only be able to be changed through its interface. This is often implemented through/results in data hiding, which is removing access to variables within a class by making the `private`, and then providing getters and setters, rather than direct access to the data. This means that some internal variables can not be externally changed if no method is provided, and operations such as validation can be performed, instead of just directly changing the data
  
  - This has the beneficial property of the internal implementation being hidden, so it can be changed and improved without changing the external interface, so other code doesn't break. Additionally, it hides the unnecessary detail of the implementation, and clarifies responsibility for the code
    
    
  
- Inheritance
  - "Creating new classes from existing ones, reducing programmer effort"
  - "Allowing an object to acquire the properties and methods of another object", so that code can be re-used, along with helping abstractions and hierarchy.
    - A subclass inherits all the properties from its superclass, and may have some additional ones of its own, and/or override some of the parents, however, it must not remove methods from the parent class (known as Liskov substitution principle)
  - The `super` keyword is used to refer to methods and properties of the superclass
  - Method overriding is when a subclass changes the definition of a function defined by its superclass. It is somewhat like overloading with different numbers of parameters for methods. If a method defined in the superclass is re-defined for the subclass, it will override it. This means that instances of the superclass will run the superclass definition, but those of the subclass will run the subclass definition, without the parent class being modified, and the subclass still retaining all other parent properties without having to redefine them
    - Class constructors are not inherited from their superclasses. To keep the functionality of their parent class, they can call the parent class constructor using `super()`, and then add any additional functionality later in the constructor. This method call must always be the first thing in the subclass constructor if it is used.
  - A subclass can only inherit from one superclass, to avoid name-collisions if two superclasses implemented the same method signature differently
  
  
  
- Polymorphism (English definition "the condition of occurring in several different forms")

  - Using objects that can take many forms - allows us to invoke operations from derived classes while using a base class reference at run-time
  - "Polymorphism describes its ability to process objects of different types through a single uniform interface"
  - Static polymorphism ([source](https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-static-and-dynamic-polymorphism-in-java/))
    - Occurs at compile time
    - An example is method overloading
      - Different behaviour is exhibited by the same method (in a given class) dependent on its interface, e.g. having different input types
  - Dynamic polymorphism ([source](https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-static-and-dynamic-polymorphism-in-java/))
    - Occurs at runtime
    - An example is method overriding
      - Methods in subclasses having different behaviour to the equivalent method in their superclass
      - Allows us to cast objects which are stored in their superclass to their subclass, so we can use their subclass interfaces
      - "Relating to the class hierarchy within a program"



### Access modifiers

- `public` - can be accessed everywhere in the program
- `private` - can only be accessed from within its own class (including different instances of the same class)
- `protected` - can only be accessed from within its own class, or any subclasses (like `private`, but including subclasses)
- Default, `package-private` - can only be accessed from within the same package

### The static and final keywords

- The `static` keyword denotes something that "belongs to the class not the object", i.e. something which is not dependent on an individual object instances state
  - Static properties are shared across all instances of the class
  - Static methods are called from the class name, not the object name
  - Static blocks are only executed once, the first time the class is loaded in memory

- The `final` keyword denotes a variable which defines a constant whose value cannot be changed after it has been set



## Abstract classes, interfaces

### Abstract classes

- When superclasses become so generic they contain methods which are only well-defined for their subclasses, they are called "abstract".

- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but it can be inherited from, acting as a pattern for subclasses

- Abstract classes can still have a constructor and this can be referred to using `super()`. This is particularly useful for when all subclasses share a name or ID

- They can contain a mix of abstract and concrete methods

  - Abstract methods provide the method signature, but not the implementation. All abstract methods must be implemented by any subclasses.
  - Concrete/non-abstract methods are ones which will be the same for all subclasses, so they are fully defined, and will just be inherited as usual into the subclasses

- Typically, abstract classes are used to "provide partial implementation"

- Example:

  ```java
  abstract class GraphicObject {
      //Member variables
      private int x, y;
      
      //Optional constructor, default no arg constructor is inferred otherwise.
      
      //A concrete method
      public void moveTo(int newX, int newY) {
          this.x = newX;
          this.y = newY;
      }
      
      //Abstract method
      public abstract void draw();
  }
  
  class Circle extends GraphicObject {
      private int radius;
      
      //Constructor
      public Circle(int radius) {
          this.radius = radius;
      }
      
      //moveTo already implemented through inheritance
      
      public void draw() {
          //Implementation must be provided
          System.out.println("Circle");
      }
  }
  ```

  - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html

### Interfaces

- If an abstract class contains *only* abstract methods, and no concrete implementations of methods, it is called an "interface"

  - Hence, interfaces have similar properties to abstract classes, including not being able to be instantiated, so having no constructor

- Whilst only one class can be inherited, multiple interfaces can be "implemented". This is to avoid the issue of two superclasses providing different implementations for the same method. The `implements` keyword is used instead of the `extends` one to indicate inheritance/implementation

- Concrete classes implement interfaces, but interfaces can still extend other interfaces to inherit from them

- Typically, interfaces are used to "encapsulate a small subset of functionality"

- Example

  ```java
  interface Foo {
      //No constructor
      
      //Only providing method signatures without implementations
      public void doFoo();
      public void undoFoo();
  }
  
  class Bar implements Foo {
      private int x;
      
      //Provide implementations for all of the interface methods
      public void doFoo() {
          x++;
      }
      
      public void undoFoo() {
          x--;
      }
  }
  ```

## Exceptions

- The `try..catch..finally` statement
  - The code in the `try` block is executed. If an exception is generated, the appropriate `catch` block is executed
  - Multiple `catch` blocks can be used, but they act like a `switch` statement, moving downwards, selecting the first to match, so if a subclass lies below a superclass, it will never be executed
  - The `finally` block is run irrespective of whether the `catch` was executed, even if there is a `return` within one of the blocks
- The `throws` keyword can be added to a method declaration to indicate that it might "throw" a checked exception of a given type
- The `throw` keyword is used to throw a new exception from a method, and must be followed by an object that is an instance of the Throwable class (e.g. `throw new ArithmeticError`)
- The "Exceptions hierarchy" (image credit [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exceptions-in-java/))
  ![exceptionsDiagram](C:\Users\egood\Desktop\dcs-notes.github.io\media\exceptionsDiagram.png)
  - In Java all errors and exceptions are subclasses of the `Throwable` class
    - Errors are "serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch". These are rare, so we will largely ignore them
    - Exceptions are "conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch"
  - There are two types of exceptions
    - Checked exceptions, which must be caught or re-thrown for the code to compile
    - Unchecked exceptions are subclasses of either `Error` or `RuntimeException`. They do not need to be specifically thrown, and while they can be caught, they don't need to be for compilation
  - Custom exceptions can be written
    - The exception should inherit from the most specific exception class that encapsulates it
      - Must be a subclass of `Throwable`
      - Any subclass of `Exception` will be checked, and any subclass of `RunTimeException` will be unchecked
    - Normally, they are just defined as inheriting from the superclass exception, then overriding the polymorphic constructors to provide appropriate error messages etc. All methods such as `printStackTrace` are then inherited from the superclass.



## Generics

- Generics allow code to enforce strong type checking at compile time, which helps avoid errors such as invalid casting at runtime. Additionally, they minimise the number of type casts needed, as they automatically return data of the specified type, and they allow writing generic algorithms to be tailored to different types
- Primitives cannot be provided as generics, as they are not objects. Instead, we need to use their object wrapper (e.g. `int` becomes `Integer`). Then, if an integer is passed in as a parameter, it will be "autoboxed" into its object wrapper to be handled internally.
- During the process of converting Java code to bytecode, the type information about objects is checked for errors, but ultimately discarded in the bytecode. For generics, the type checking before discarding the types is performed by substituting all of the instances of type variables with the type they are specified with in the instance in the code, so it can be type-checked, raising errors at compile time, not runtime.
