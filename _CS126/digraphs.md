## Directed graphs

> Directed graphs (digraphs) are graphs where **every edge** is directed. Edge $$(a,b)$$ goes from $$a$$ to $$b$$, but not the other way around.
>
> It can be applied to dependency and scheduling problems. When representing it in concrete implementations, we tend to keep in and out edges separately

### Properties

If a **simple** directed graph has $$m$$ edges and $$n$$ vertices, then $$m \leq n \cdot (n-1)$$, since every vertex can connect to every other vertex bar itself

There is more terminology specifically about digraphs:

- One vertex is said to be **reachable** from the other if there **exists a directed path** from the other to it
- A digraph is said to be **strongly connected** if **each vertex is reachable** from every other vertex

### Strong Connectivity Algorithm

We can identify strong connectivity by running DFS on a chosen vertex $$v$$ in $$G$$ and $$G’$$, where $$G’$$ is $$G$$ but with the directed edges **reversed**.

- Firstly, we perform DFS from $$v$$ in $$G$$. If there is a vertex $$u$$ **not visited**, then $$G$$ is **not** strongly connected. Otherwise, it shows that there exists a path from $$v$$ to every other vertex.
- Next we perform DFS from $$v$$ in $$G’$$. Again, if there is a vertex $$u$$ not visited it is not strongly connected. Otherwise, it shows that there exists a path from every other vertex to $$v$$. 
- If both DFS show that there is no such vertex $$u$$, then $$G$$ is strongly connected.

This has a running time of $$O(n+m)$$.

It is also possible to create maximal subgraphs with every vertex being reachable in $$O(n+m)$$ time, but this is more involved.

## Transitive closure

> - If $$G$$ has a directed path from $$u$$ to $$v$$, and $$u \neq v$$, then $$G^*$$ has a directed edge from $$u$$ to $$v$$

> The transitive closure provides reachability information about a digraph, allowing us to answer reachability questions **fast**.

Informally, this means that every pair of vertices with a path between them is adjacent in a transitive closure.

### Computing with DFS

One way of computing the transitive closure of a graph is to perform DFS on each vertex in graph to identify every reachable edge from it, then setting edges between them. 

Every run of DFS will take $$O(n+m)$$ time and because we are running it on every edge so this will take $$O(n \cdot (n+m))$$ time.

> For sparse graphs, adjacency list/adjacency map representations, or very large graphs (many nodes), DFS is a good solution.

### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

> Another way to compute the transitive closure is to use the **Floyd-Warshall algorithm**, a dynamic programming solution.

The $$G^*$$ graph starts off identical to $$G$$ with only the initial edges. We then add a direct edge between nodes which have a path of length 2 between them (only one other node separating the two nodes).

<img src=".\images\floydWarshall.png" alt="floydWarshall" class="center" />

With each iteration, we pick a “pivot” (this is my own way of saying it) node $$k$$ and we loop through all $$i$$ and $$j$$ to check if there is an edge $$i\rightarrow k$$ and $$k\rightarrow j$$ – if this is true, then we insert an edge $$i \rightarrow j$$.

After every edge is inserted, this forms a new path of length 2 between two nodes, which is then considered in a later iteration. 

```java
Algorithm FloydWarshall(G)
    Input: digraph G
    Output: transitive closure G* of G
    i <- 1
    for all v in G.vertices()
        label v with i
        i <- i + 1
    G_new <- G
    for k <- 1 to n do
        for i <- 1 to n(i != k) do
        for j <- 1 to n(j != k) do
            if G_new.areAdjacent(i,k) & G_new.areAdjacent(k,j)
            if !G_new.areAdjacent(i,j)
                G_new.insertDirectedEdge(i,j,edge_k)
    return G_new
```

> We say this is a dynamic programming algorithm because we only have to consider paths of length 2 and update the graph immediately. By resolving the transitive closure for every $$k$$ with every other $$i$$ and every other $$j$$, the end result is one that considers all possible closures and the final graph is transitively closed.

#### FW in Python

I found a good explanation of this algorithm on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO8Jfs9uZnc) which also includes a github gist of the Python implementation of this algorithm.

```python
def warshall(M):
    n = M.nrows()
    W = M
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                W[i,j] = W[i,j] or (W[i,k] and W[k,j])
    return W
```

#### Speed Analysis of FW

The running time is dominated by the 3 for-loops. If we assume that the `areAdjacent` method takes $$O(1)$$ time (which is true for **adjacency matrices**) then this algorithm is of $$O(n^3)$$ time.

> For dense graphs, and adjacency matrix representations, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is better than using DFS. Additionally, it is also algorithmically simpler.

## Topological ordering

A topological ordering of a digraph is a numbering $$v_1,\ldots,v_n$$ of the vertices such that for every directed edge $$v_i,v_j$$, we have that $$i<j$$. 

> **Theorem.** A digraph has a **topological ordering** if it is a **directed acyclic graph** (DAG – has no directed cycles). Having cycles would informally be self-dependencies

To prove the theorem above, we need to prove both ways. Showing that a digraph with a topological ordering contains no directed cycles is **trivial** (left to right). We will employ DFS to prove the other way (right to left). 

### Topological Sorting with DFS

> This DFS implementation of **topological sorting** consists of two functions that are overloaded. 
>
> - The first function takes a graph `G` and starts labelling all vertices as `unexplored`. 
> - Then for every vertex, if the label is `unexplored` we call the **second** function.

```java
Algorithm topologicalDFS(G) // First function
    Input: DAG G
    Output: Topological ordering of G
    n <- G.numVertices()
    for all u in G.vertices()
        setLabel(u, "unexplored")
    for all v in G.vertices()
        if getLabel(v) == "unexplored"
            topologicalDFS(G,v)     // 2nd Function
```

Here we set the starting vertex `v` to `visited`, and then for all edges that originate from `v` we check if the destination vertex `w` is `unexplored`. 

```java
Algorithm topologicalDFS(G,v) // 2nd Function
    Input: graph G and a start vertex v of G
    Output: Labelling of the vertices of G in the connected component of v
    setLabel(v, "visited")
    for all e in G.outEdges(v)
        w <- opposite(v,e)
        if getLabel(w) == "unexplored" // e is a discovery edge
            topologicalDFS(G,w)
            setLabel(e, "cross")
        // else we do nothing
    Label v with topological number n
    n <- n - 1
```

Taking the following graph as an example, let’s start at vertex `A`. We first begin by labelling vertex `A` as `visited` and we loop through all the vertices that `A` has an edge to.

<img src="./images/toposort1.svg" class="center"/>

If any are unexplored, then the edge has **not been traversed** before and we call the 2nd function on the destination vertex recursively, in this case lets say the loop starts with `G`. Then the same thing happens to `G` (as it is a recursive call). 

This will continue until we arrive at a vertex `D` with **no outgoing unexplored edge**.

- When this happens, we label `D` with the current number for the topological ordering (this number starts at $$n = \text{number of vertices in G}$$). After which, we decrement `n`.
- Then as **an effect** of the recursive calls, the algorithm **backtracks** to the previous vertex $$d_x$$ (i.e `J`). 
  - All remaining outgoing edges of $$d_x$$ are checked and there will be **further recursive calls** to the 2nd function if any edges have **not** been traversed.
  - The next vertex with no outgoing edge $$d_{n-1}$$ will be labelled with `n-1`. In our example this is `J`. 

- This goes on, and we will notice that after every exit from a recursive call, there will always be a vertex with no outgoing unexplored edge.

Hence, we will be able to arrive at a topological ordering of $$G$$.

> **Note.** You may observer that if we start at a different root edge, the topological ordering will be different. Hence, it is possible for one DAG to have multiple topological orderings.
