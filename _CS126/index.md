# Welcome to the CS126 revision guide


## Complete Notes

Given the large number of topics, it makes sense to break these down into
broader topics when revising - each of which having its own page.

Or access the [CS126 One Page Notes](opnotes).

These were written by **Edmund Goodman** and **Justin Tan** with contributions from **Leon Chipchase**:

1. [x] [Arrays and Lists](arrays-and-lists)
2. [x] [Analysis of algorithms](algorithm-analysis)
3. [x] [Recursive algorithms](recursive-algorithms)
4. [x] [Stacks and Queues](stacks-and-queues)
5. [x] [Maps, hash tables and sets](maps-hash-tables-and-sets)
6. [x] [Trees](trees)
7. [x] [Priority queues & Heaps](priority-queues)
8. [x] [Skip lists](skip-lists)
9.  [x] [Self-balancing trees](balanced-trees)
10. [x] [Graphs](graphs)
11. [x] [Directed Graphs](digraphs)
12. [ ] [General algorithms](general-algorithms)



Detailed handwritten notes for CS126 by **Josh Fitzmaurice** which cover the entire module split into two parts can be can be found below:

1. [Part 1](./cs126-notes-1.pdf)
2. [Part 2](./cs126-notes-2.pdf)

These are a set of handwritten notes for lectures 4 to 12 by **Akram Ahmad**. You can access each lecture individually- be warned that these are not immensely detailed and it is not easy to fix errors for handwritten notes.

1. [Algorithm Analysis](./akrampdf/4 - Algorithm Analysis.pdf)
2. [Queue ADT](./akrampdf/5 Queue ADT.pdf)
3. [Stack ADT](./akrampdf/5 Stack- ADT.pdf)
4. [Recursion](./akrampdf/5- Recursion.pdf)
5. [List ADT](./akrampdf/6 List ADT.pdf)
6. [Maps](./akrampdf/7 Maps.pdf)
7. [Hash Tables](./akrampdf/8 - Hash tables.pdf)
8. [Set ADT](./akrampdf/9 - Set.pdf)
9. [Tree ADT](./akrampdf/10 - Trees.pdf)
10. [Priority Queue ADT](./akrampdf/11 - Priority Queue.pdf)
11. [Heap ADT](./akrampdf/12 - Heaps.pdf)

Here are a set of flashcards for the module by **Leon Chipchase** (they still need to be refined), and please message me if there is something incorrect on there.
