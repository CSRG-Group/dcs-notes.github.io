# Welcome to the CS118 Revision Guide

## [Full notes for the module](./opnotes)

The main set of notes for this module which is linked in the above heading were written in collaboration by **Akram Ahmad** and **Justin Tan**

### Individual topics

Given the large number of topics, it makes sense to break these down into broader topics when revising - each of which having its own page. These are linked below by section:

1. [x] [Variables, number systems, and I/O](part1.html) (1 to 4 from above)
2. [x] [Conditional and iterative statements](part2.html) (5 to 6)
3. [x] [Arrays, methods, scope and recursion](part3.html) (7 to 9)
4. [x] [Object oriented programming](part4.html) (10 to 12)
5. [x] [Abstract classes and inheritance](part5.html) (13 to 16)
6. [x] [Exceptions](part6.html) (17)
7. [x] [Generics](part7.html) (18)

### Crib sheet

Notes by **Edmund Goodman** acting as a "Crib sheet" for the module, only covering the more complex content [can be found here](cribSheet.html)



## Additional resources

### Flash cards

Flash cards for the module by **Leon Chipchase** [can be found here](https://quizlet.com/_9qa4vn?x=1jqt&i=18al03) ([plaintext export](./media/exportedQuizlet118.txt)), which are based off the existing notes on this page.

### Additional notes

Full notes covering the entire module written by **Edmund Goodman** which were cut down to form the crib sheet [can be found here](combined.html)

## Discussion of module content

There are five broad topics overall which were split into 11 lectures - within these topics, the main sections of content are:

1. Storing values in Java
2. Primitive types
3. Operating on variables
4. Pre- and post-increment
5. Branching (`if`...`else`)
6. Bounded and unbounded repetition
7. Declaring an array
8. Passing by value (parameters) and passing by reference (objects and arrays)
9. Recursion definition and requirements
10. OOP principles
11. Constructor methods
12. The `static` keyword
13. The `super` and `this` keyword
14. Dynamic polymorphism
15. Abstract classes and functions
16. Interfaces
17. Exceptions
18. Generics

Anyone who has completed the CS118 and CS126 courseworks should be confident with most of the content, so should focus their time on the more difficult topics, which include but are not limited to:

 - IEEE-754 floating point
 - Static and dynamic polymorphism
 - Abstract classes and interfaces

Along with topics with odd nuances, again including but not limited to:

 - Operator precedence (including pre- and post-increment, and lazy and strict evaluation)
 - Switch statement execution, including `break` and `default` keywords
 - Passing by value / reference
 - Encapsulation vs. data hiding
