<h3 id="important-definitions">Important definitions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Span</strong> of \(U\): the set of all linear combinations of vectors in \(U\). The span describes all points reachable by a linear combination of the vectors in \(U\).</li>
  <li><strong>Subspace</strong> of \(\mathbf{R}^{n}\): this is a non-empty subset \(S\) of \(\mathbf{R}^{n}\) with properties that all vectors are <strong>closed</strong> under <strong>addition and <em>scalar</em> multiplication</strong>. This can be described as a vector space that is a <strong>subset</strong> of a larger vector space. Remember that the subspace is the <strong>span</strong> of its constituent vectors.
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>intersection</strong> of a subspace is simply all the vectors that are shared by both.</li>
      <li>Every subspace of \(\mathbf{R}^{n}\) <strong>contains the zero vector</strong></li>
      <li>If \(U\) is a non-empty, finite subset of \(\mathbf{R}^{n}\) then the <em>span</em> of \(U\) is a subspace of \(\mathbf{R}^{n}\) and is called the subspace spanned or generated by \(U\). This means you need to know what elements are in \(U\) to define a ‚Äòsubset‚Äô of this space by spanning the entire set of these vectors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Basis</strong>: If for a subspace \(S\), all vectors \(s \in S\) are <strong>linearly independent</strong> and they <strong>span \(S\)</strong>, you have a <strong>basis</strong> of a vector space.
    <ul>
      <li><em>There cannot be more vectors in a basis than the dimension of the vector space they span.</em> It is not possible to have three vectors in a basis for \(\mathbf{R}^{2}\); hence if you have this many vectors, then it is not a basis as one vector will be a linear combination of another before it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <li>Show that the subspace contains the <strong>zero vector</strong>.</li>
      <li>Show that each vector in the set \(S\) is <strong>linearly independent</strong> to find the vectors that will form a basis for \(\mathbf{R}^{n}\).</li>

  <li>Find the coordinates of a vector \(v\) with respect to basis \(U\) and basis \(W\).
    <ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="matrices">Matrices</h2>

<h3 id="basic-arithmetic">Basic arithmetic</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Multiply the two matrices \(M\) and \(N\)
    <ul>
      <li>Two matrices are only multipliable if the number of columns on \(M\) is the same as the number of rows on \(N\).
        <ul>
          <li>Visualise this by taking a single row of \(M\); rotate it 90 degrees; can you fit this inside the matrix \(N\)?</li>
          <li>If this is not possible then you cannot multiply the two matrices, as you will not have enough values for the operation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Sum the products of each element as you iteratively advance the <strong>row</strong> of \(M\) and the <strong>column</strong> of \(N\).</li>
      <li>The number of row-\(M\) and column-\(N\) will determine where to put this sum-value in the new matrix. This can be seen as ‚Äòrun-and-dive‚Äô.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Matrix of minors:</strong> Replace each element \(a..i\)  with the minor for that row and column- basically if you were working out the determinant by expanding along that row.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Matrix of cofactors:</strong> Multiply the values of the matrix of minors with the signs of the alternating pattern, \([+, -, +, -, ...]\) for the first row; the second row is a leftwards rotation of this pattern, and so are any further rows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  <li><strong>Interchanging</strong> of two rows; \(\|B\|=-\|A\|\).</li>
  <li><strong>Adding a multiple of one row to another</strong>; the determinant does not change.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="linear-transformations">Linear Transformations</h3>

      <li>\(M.(a)=A\) where \(A\) is the <strong>column vector of coordinates for your answer</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>This is achieved because we can represent \(\mathbf{T}(a)\) as \(M.(a)\) where \(M\) is the matrix that represents a linear transformation, and \((a)\) is the column vector of coordinates for our input to the transformation.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Change the coordinates of vector \(a\) from basis \(V\) to basis \(W\).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You can use a <strong>transition matrix</strong> \(M\) to get from coordinates of \(a\) in \(V\) to coordinates of \(a\) in \(W\).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <strong>transition matrix</strong> \(M\) is made up of the <strong>column vectors</strong> of the <strong><em>basis vectors of \(V\)</em></strong> once they have been <strong>converted</strong> to the <strong>basis of \(W\)</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once you have this, you can find the coordinates of \(a\) in terms of \(W\) by the following expression:

= M
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{1}^{V} \\

    <ul>
      <li>Use L‚ÄôHopital‚Äôs Rule to calculate the limit of \(f'(x)\); if both functions \(g(x)\) and \(h(x)\) are differentiable, then \(f'(x)=\frac{g'(x)}{h'(x)}\). You can repeat this until you gain a value for a limit.</li>

      <li>Represent \(f(x)\) as a form of \(e^{a log b}\) (you will have to use some intuition here) and then differentiate the expression to achieve the expression on the right-hand side.</li>
      <li>Note that for \(a&gt;0, a^{x}=e^{xloga}\). Note the rules for differentiating logarithms and differentiating the exponential function.</li>

<h2 id="taylors-theorem">Taylor‚Äôs Theorem</h2>

<h3 id="quick-definitions">Quick definitions</h3>

<p>The Taylor series can be defined as
\(\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\frac{f^{(n)}{(a)}}{n!}(x-a)^{n}\)
Since we use Taylor‚Äôs Theorem to calculate an approximation for a function, we will typically have a remainder left over, \(R_{n}(x)\) where
\(R_{n}(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}\)
for some number \(c\) between \(a\) and \(x\). The <strong>Taylor polynomial</strong> refers to the polynomial expression derived after \(n\) many expansions of the Taylor series.</p>

<p>When we pick \(a=0\) for the Taylor series, we arrive at the Maclaurin series which is defined similarly:
\(\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\frac{f^{(n)}{(0)}}{n!}(x)^{n}\)
We can still use the above expression for the remainder left by the approximation by substituting a value of \(0\) for \(a\). However, given by the squeeze rule, we will typically find that \(R_{n} \rightarrow 0\) which shows that the Maclaurin series expansion is valid for all \(x \in \mathbf{R}\). <strong>Focus on the absolute value for \(R_{n}(x)\)</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-estimate-of-the-error">Finding the estimate of the error</h3>

<p>Using the above equations, once we have a polynomial from either the Maclaurin or Taylor series, we just need to pick our value for \(c\); this is always a value between \(x\) (the value we have been given) and \(a\) , which is set to 0 by definition for the Maclaurin series. <strong>You may need to do some rearranging to ensure that your value for \(c\)</strong> is correct.</p>

<p><strong>You should aim for</strong> \(f^{(n+1)}(c)\) <strong>to be as large as possible</strong> to get the largest possible absolute value for \(R_{n}(x)\). Don‚Äôt feel afraid to make arbitrary guesses for \(c\) to ensure this.</p>

<h2 id="first-order-odes">First Order ODEs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Find the general solution of \(\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x)g(y)=0\).
    <ul>
      <li>This is a homogeneous separable equation and is solved by <strong>taking integrals</strong>.</li>
      <li>Get \(dy, g(y)\) onto one side of the equation and hence \(dx, f(x)\) onto the other side of the equation. You will typically have a fraction of the form \(\frac{1}{h(y)}\) and \(\frac{1}{k(x)}\).</li>
      <li>Once you have taken integrals of both sides you will end up with \(log(h(y))=m(x)+c\) ; raise each to the power of \(e\) and then simplify the expression.</li>
      <li><strong>You may choose to introduce a variable \(vx=y\)</strong> to help simplify an integral, as this will lead to a <strong>separable equation</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>Remember to substitute the value of \(v\) back into the expression.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
