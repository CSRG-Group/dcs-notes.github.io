        * Safari
        * ...
    * Mobile Devices
    * What happens on unsupported browsers?

        * Caching data/ assets
        * More Efficient queries
* Security Testing
    * SQL , XSS injection attacks
    * Update policy
    * Software stack, correct settings, updated software etc...

### Test Driven Development

Writing code to satisfy tests

Should know what your code need to do before it is written

Write the test before writing the code

* Red
    * Write a failing test, should stat what needs to happen
* Green
    * Code Meeds the test
* Refactor
    * Make the code safe, secure and beautiful

Run Test frequently 

Tests can be run automatically on submission to the central repository
