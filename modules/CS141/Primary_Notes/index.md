## [Full notes for the module](opnotes)

The main set of notes for this module which is linked in the above heading were written by **Justin Tan** and **Edmund Goodman**:

### Individual topics

Given the large number of topics, it makes sense to break these down into broader topics when revising - each of which having its own page. These are linked below by section:

1. [x] [General Functional Programming](part1)
2. [x] [Lazy Evaluation & Recursion](part2)
3. [x] [Higher-Order Functions](part3)
4. [x] [Data types](datatypes)
5. [x] [Equational reasoning](equationalReasoning)
6. [x] [Functors, Applicatives, Monads](FAM)
<<<<<<< HEAD:_CS141/index.md
7. [x] [Type-level programming](type-level-programming)

### Crib sheets

Refer to the [crib sheet](cribsheet) for laws and associativity in Haskell syntax!
