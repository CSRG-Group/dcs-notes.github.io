# Welcome to the CS132 revision guide

## Topics and content

There are five broad topics in the module, which are as follows:

1. Data representation
2. Digital logic
3. Assembler
4. Memory systems
5. I/O mechanisms
6. Processor architecture

In the words of Matt, **all of the above topics are examinable**. However, there
are varying degrees of usefulness for each of the topics - if something is not
deemed overly useful, it will typically be omitted in the notes. For example,
for processor architecture topic, most proprietary knowledge will likely be
omitted (for example, specific operations of the circuit).

## Complete notes

Detailed handwritten notes for CS132 by **Josh Fitzmaurice** which cover the
entire module can be found [here](./CS132_full.pdf).

Detailed typed notes for CS132 by **Yijun Hu** can be found [here](https://www.yijun.hu/blog-cs/cs132/index.html).

## Unofficial worksheet solutions

We are in the process of compiling student-written solutions to the worksheets
provided for 132. Please note that these do not necessarily hit all the marking
points, nor are guaranteed to be correct.

## Flash Cards
Here are a set of flashcards for the module by **Leon Chipchase** (they still need to be refined), and please message me if there is something incorrect on there.
