# Welcome to the CS132 revision guide

## Topics and content

There are five broad topics in the module, which are as follows:

1. Data representation
2. Digital logic
3. Assembler
4. Memory systems
5. I/O mechanisms
6. Processor architecture

In the words of Matt, **all of the above topics are examinable**. However, there are varying degrees of usefulness for each of the topics - if something is not deemed overly useful, it will typically be omitted in the notes. For example, for processor architecture topic, most proprietary knowledge will likely be omitted (for example, specific operations of the circuit).

## Complete notes

Detailed handwritten notes for CS132 by **Josh Fitzmaurice** which cover the entire module can be found [here](./CS132_full.pdf).


Detailed typed notes for CS132 by **Yijun Hu** can be found [here](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs132/index.html). (*as of the end of april these are WIP*)

These notes will likely take the same/similar form to the CS118 notes. The primary source for these will be from my (Akram) notes; any other sources or contributions will be duly cited/ attributed.
