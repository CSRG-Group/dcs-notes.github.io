## Thank you for your interest in contributing to this revision guide.

We welcome pull requests from anyone who is happy to share their notes, and would be incredibly grateful for any input of content for the individual pages! We will try to provide any reasonable attribution you would like for content you contribute, and any contributions mean we get a more full coverage of the content finished faster, so everyone on the course can benefit from high quality shared notes.

Contributing to a project such as this can seem intimidating at first as there are many technologies and hundreds of files however many of these can be ignored for most contributions. We have tried to make contributions as easy as possible and the tutorials should be detailed enough for everyone. Finally we would much rather you attempt to contribute to the site and fail than to have no contributions at all. The probability of completely breaking the site is very low and any errors are likely to be graphical or content errors rather than technical.
