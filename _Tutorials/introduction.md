## Accuracy

### Disclaimer

The content on this site is produced by students and while reasonable efforts are made to ensure accuracy, no claims of accuracy are made for this site all users should bear this in mind.

### Submission of a fix

Please thoroughly research a topic/correction before making a pull request on the matter, to ensure accuracy.

The standard fix for an error in the documents to submit a pull request with any corrections (see blow) if you are uncomfortable with this you can contact the author of the content or the maintainers fo the site (see the contact me section)

#### Errata

Many times an error can easily be fixed by the reader for small technical, spelling or formatting errors in notes or crib sheets that are obvious oversights a pull request can be submitted to apply the fix.

If you can make the change yourself by editing the appropriate file, consider making a pull request to the repository (for pdf files, annotations by tools such as [xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp) should be used) and submit it through GitHub. This will also list you as a contributor to the project :smile:.

#### Larger errors

For large technical errors or for errors in the quiz such as impossible questions we ask that you check with the author, or at least another student studying the course before submitting the pull request and provide evidence that the fix is correct. Also bear in mind that some content on the course may be simplified and although not factually the ground truth is functionally correct for the course and so should not be changed.

### Improving Clarity

You may find content that while technically accurate lacks clarity or is difficult to understand it is requested that you contact the module author before making edits of this types.
