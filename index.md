# Welcome to the Warwick first year Computer Science revision guide

This website is a collection of notes for the modules in the first year computer science degree at the University of Warwick.

It is entirely student-run, and not affiliated with or endorsed by the University. If at any point we are told this goes against DCS anti-plagiarism guidelines, or any other policy, we will immediately take it down. Additionally, we cannot provide guarantees that all the notes are correct as all content is written by students, however, we will try our hardest to maintain quality.

## Notes

### [CS118: Programming for Computer Scientists](cs118/index.html)

### [CS130: Mathematics for Computer Scientists I](cs130/index.md)

### [CS140: Computer Security](cs140/index.md)

More modules will be added as we accumulate notes on them.

## Licensing and downloading

This work is licensed under Creative Commons "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International", and the full license document can be found [here](./LICENSE.txt). Essentially, attribute any content to the people who made it, don't use it to make money, and, even if you change the content, share it under the same license.

If you want to take a local download of the repository, please consider taking a fork as opposed to a clone, as that means it is easier for you to both stay up to date, and to contribute later if you want to. Furthermore, it helps us to some extent see how many people are interested in what we are doing.

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests from anyone who is happy to share their notes, and would be incredibly grateful for any input of content for the individual pages. We will try to provide any attribution you would like for content you contribute. If you decide you'd like to help contribute, do submit a pull request! This would mean we get full coverage of the content finished faster, and everyone on the course can benefit from high quality shared notes.

Currently, most of the notes are in markdown (`.md`) format, but we also support most other file formats, for example static webpages and PDFs. We are also very happy to add photographs of written notes, but a benefit of electronic formats is that they can be quickly searched (the `ctrl+f` key is going to be used pretty heavily in open book exams).

### Errata

If you think you have found a mistake in any of the notes, please tell us! If you feel comfortable making a pull request, you can make the change yourself by editing the appropriate file (for pdf files, annotations by tools such as [Xournal](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp) should be used) and submit it through GitHub. Otherwise, see the "Contact us" section for how to tell us about it (if you know who made the notes, they're probably the best people to ask to get it fixed).

### How to make a pull request

1. On the repository's [page on GitHub](https://github.com/arkamnite/dcs-notes.github.io), click the "Fork repository" button
2. Clone your fork of the repository to your computer by running the command `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/dcs-notes.github.io`
3. Create a new branch on your local repository by running the command `git checkout -b <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>`. Naming the branch as a very brief description of what the change entails is helpful for us when accepting pull requests.
4. Set a new remote server for the upstream repository by running the command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/arkamnite/dcs-notes.github.io`
5. Make your changes/contributions, then add and commit your changes to the repository (with `git add -A` and `git commit -m "<COMMIT_MESSAGE>"` respectively)
6. Push your changes to the remote server by running the command `git push -u origin <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>`
7. On the repository's [page on GitHub](https://github.com/arkamnite/dcs-notes.github.io), after the changes have been pushed, a green "Compare & pull request" button will appear. Click on it, then click on the green "Create pull request" button which will appear afterwards. After this is done, we will be able to merge it in to the repository, or we might ask you to make some changes before we do so

If you are still confused, try Google-Fu on how to make a pull request, or see the "Contact us" section to ask us about it.
