## Welcome to the CS118 revision guide

### Topics and content

There are five broad topics overall which were split into 11 lectures- these specific topics are as follows:

1. Storing values in Java
2. Primitive types
3. Operating on variables
4. Pre- and post-increment
5. Branching (`if`...`else`)
6. Bounded and unbounded repetition
7. Declaring an array
8. Passing by value (parameters) and passing by reference (objects and arrays)
9. Recursion definition and requirements
10. OOP principles
11. Constructor methods
12. The `static` keyword
13. The `super` and `this` keyword
14. Dynamic polymorphism
15. Abstract classes and functions
16. Interfaces
17. Exceptions
18. Generics

As you can see, this is quite a bit of content. Therefore, it means you can probably gauge your current progress by running through this list and asking yourself how much you are familiar with.

Anyone who has completed the CS118 and CS126 courseworks should be confident with most of the content, so should focus their time on the more difficult topics, which include but are not limited to:
 - IEEE-754 floating point
 - Static and dynamic polymorphism
 - Abstract classes and interfaces

Along with topics with odd nuances, again including but not limited to:
 - Operator precedence (including pre- and post-increment, and lazy and strict evaluation)
 - Switch statement execution, including `break` and `default` keywords
 - Passing by value / reference
 - Encapsulation vs. data hiding



### Complete Notes

Many thanks to **Edmund Goodman** who has generously contributed his notes. These cover the entire topic and can be found on [this page](./combined.html). A cut down version of the notes covering only the non-trivial content can be found on [this page.](cribSheet.html)



Given the large number of topics, it makes sense to break these down into broader topics- these will each form their own pages, and will be activated as progress on them continues:

1. [x] [Variables, number systems, and I/O](part1.md) (1 to 4 from above)
2. [x] [Conditional and iterative statements](part2.md) (5 to 6)
3. [x] [Arrays, methods, scope and recursion](part3.md) (7 to 9)
4. [x] [Object oriented programming](part4.md) (10 to 12)
5. [x] [Abstract classes and inheritance](part5.md) (13 to 16)
6. [x] [Exceptions](part6.md) (17)
7. [x] [Generics](part7.md) (18)
