<p>Please thoroughly research a topic/correction before making a pull request on the matter, to ensure accuracy.</p>

<p>Many times an error can easily be fixed by the reader for small technical, spelling or formatting errors in notes or crib sheets that are obvious oversights a pull request can be submitted to apply the fix.</p>

<p>If you can make the change yourself by editing the appropriate file, consider making a pull request to the repository (for pdf files, annotations by tools such as <a href="https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp">xournal++</a> should be used) and submit it through GitHub. This will also list you as a contributor to the project :smile:.</p>

<h3 id="larger-errors">Larger errors</h3>

<p>For large technical errors or for errors in the quiz such as impossible questions we ask that you check with the author, or at least another student studying the course before submitting the pull request and provide evidence that the fix is correct. Also bear in mind that some content on the course may be simplified and although not factually the ground truth is functionally correct for the course and so should not be changed.</p>

<h2 id="improving-clarity">Improving Clarity</h2>
<p>You may find content that while technically accurate lacks clarity or is difficult to understand it is requested that you contact the module author before making edits of this types.</p>
