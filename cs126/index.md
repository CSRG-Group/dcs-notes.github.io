# Welcome to the CS126 revision guide


## Complete Notes

Given the large number of topics, it makes sense to break these down into
broader topics when revising - each of which having its own page.

These were written by **Edmund Goodman**:

1. [x] [Arrays and Lists](part1.md)
2. [ ] [Analysis of algorithms](part2.md)
3. [ ] [Recursive algorithms](part3.md)
4. [x] [Stacks and Queues](part4.md)
5. [x] [Maps, hash tables and sets](part5.md)
6. [x] [Trees](part6.md)
7. [x] [Priority queues](part7.md)
8. [x] [Heaps](part8.md)
9. [ ] [Skip lists](part9.md)
10. [ ] [Self-balancing trees](part10.md)
11. [ ] [Graphs](part11.md)
12. [ ] [General algorithms](part12.md)


A *development* version of the notes containing WIP material is available [here](./cribSheet.md), but will not render correctly in GitHub pages, as it has not been ported across yet.
