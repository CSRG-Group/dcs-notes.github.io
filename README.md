## Introduction

Thank you for visiting this site! This repository contains a collection of notes for the modules in the first year computer science degree at the University of Warwick. It is entirely student-run, and not affiliated with or endorsed by the University. If at any point we are told this goes against DCS anti-plagiarism guidelines, or any other policy, we will immediately take it down. Additionally, we cannot provide guarantees that all the notes are correct as all content is written by students, however, we will try our hardest to maintain quality.

## Contributing

We would be incredibly grateful for any input of content for the individual pages; if you decide you'd like to help contribute to individual pages, do submit a pull request! This would mean we get full coverage of the content finished faster, and everyone on the course can benefit from high quality shared notes.

## Licensing

This work is licensed under Creative Commons "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International", and the full license document can be found [here](./LICENSE.txt). Essentially, attribute any content to the people who made it, don't use it to make money, and, even if you change the content, share it under the same license.

## Downloading

If you want to take a local download of the repository, please consider taking a fork as opposed to a clone, as that means it is easier for you to both stay up to date, and to contribute later if you want to. Furthermore, it helps us to some extent see how many people are interested in what we are doing.
