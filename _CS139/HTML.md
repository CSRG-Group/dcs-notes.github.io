# Introduction
Stands for HyperText Markup Language.

HTML is a __semantic__ language it describes the structure of the document and not the content.

# HTML Nesting structure
## Parent 
A tag is a parent of another if it immediately encloses the tag.
## Child
A tag is a child of another if it is immediately enclosed by the tag.
## Ancestor
A tag is an ancestor if it is the parent or the parent of an ancestor of a tag.
## Descendant
A tag is an descendant if it is the child or the child of a descendant of a tag.
## Sibling
Two tags are siblings if they share a parent.

# Basic Syntax
HTML uses code tags for opening and closing to give information about the content inside, opening use `<>` and closing starts with a backslash `</>`

The tags can also contain attributes with additional information like the class or ids.

Desc| Code
----|-------
Opening tag | `<a href="www.google.com">`
element Name| `<a`
Attribute   | `href="www.google.com"`
content     | `a search engine`
closing tag | `</a>`

Example of a HTML tag: `<a href="www.google.com"> a search engine </a>`

## Empty tags

Some tags have no content and so are empty, a closing tag is not needed.
`<meta charset="utf-8">`

# HTML Nesting
All closing tags should occur in the reverse order they were opened. e.g

`<h1> Share your <strong> Travels </strong><h1>`

is correct

`<h1> Share your <strong> Travels <h1></strong>`

is incorrect

# Character Entities
Some symbols need to be represented with special characters so they are formatted correctly.

Entity | Description
---|---
`&nbsp;` | non breakable space
`&lt;`|&lt;
`&gt;`|&gt;
`&copy;`| &copy;
`&trade;`| &trade;


# Block vs Inline
Some elements are blocks these start and end with a new line. Examples are:
* `<h1>`
* `<p>`
* `<ul>`
* `<table>`
* `<div>`

Other elements are inline and can normally be integrated into a line of text without breaking it up.
* `<a>`
* `<img>`
* `<span>`

# Validation
