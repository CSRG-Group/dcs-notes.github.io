<p align=center>A <b>security protocol</b> is a fixed pattern of exchanges (steps) between 2 or more communication parties to achieve a security related task.</p>

## Diffie-Hellman-Merkel Key Exchange Protocol

*For brevity sake, I will refer to it as DHM*

> We use the DHM protocol when two parties wish to **communicate privately**, but the **communication channel is not secure** (everything can be read by outsiders), and they want to use **secret key encryption**. 

To do so, A and B have to first publicly agree on values for y and p in a modular exponentiation one way function: $$y^x \!\!\mod p$$

- $$y$$ needs to be the primitive root of $$p$$
- $$p$$ is an enormously large prime number
- The two numbers can be publicly known

Then A chooses a secret number, $$a$$ and..

- Put $$a$$ into the one-way function and computes the result $$y^a \!\!\mod p = v_A$$
- A sends $$v_A$$ to B and receives $$v_B$$ from B
- A applies their function to $$v_B$$: $$(v_B)^a \!\!\mod p$$
- B does the same with $$(v_A)^b \!\!\mod p$$, where $$b$$ is B’s secret number.

A and B will **arrive at the same value** which they use as their secret key $$s$$.
$$
(v_A)^b \!\!\mod p = (v_B)^a \!\!\mod p = s
$$

## Authentication Protocol

Normally when working in a local environment (**secure channel**) with a fixed link to the host, we use passwords to authenticate a user. However, more must be done over **insecure channels**.

> Either use **encrypted passwords**, **digital signature**, or **public key encryption** for authentication.

Recall how public keys can be used to ensure integrity and non-repudiation, provided that the public key is trusted. Why can’t it provide authentication as well?

### Replay Attack

> Let’s say A sends B a message encrypted by KU<sub>A</sub>, B acknowledges that A is in fact A. However E also stores this message but does not touch it. After the communication with A and B is over, E can **replay** the message to B and B would accept E as A.

**Solution 1.** B generates a token R, which is a random number (also called a *nonce* :eyes: ), that A needs to sign for authentication. The interaction can be formalised with the notation below. The final authenticated token, if encrypted with A’s private key can only mean it was authenticated by A.

1. A –> B : A
2. B –> A : R
3. A –> B : [R]<sub>A</sub>

**Solution 2.** Timestamping. When A sends message to B, they include a timestamp in the encrypted message. If the message is replayed by E, B will know that it is an old message.

### Mutual Authentication

Our above examples are a **unilateral authentication**: A authenticates B

**Mutual authentication.** Two-way authentication

1. A –> B : A, R<sub>A</sub>
2. B –> A : R<sub>B</sub>, [R<sub>A</sub>]<sub>B</sub> – In this step, A will know that B is truly B (as long as public key verified)
3. A –> B : [R<sub>B</sub>]<sub>A</sub>       – Here B, will know A is A

## Authentication Spoofing

> There’s still a problem with our protocol. A could communicate with E, but E could be malicious and decide to pass on the message to B. Now B will pass the token to E and E passes it to A and then passes the encrypted token back to B from A.
>
> As a result, B thinks that they are communicating with A.
>
> This is often referred to as a "man-in-the-middle" (MITM) attack

**Solution 1.** Include the identity of the intended recipient encrypted along with the token from the recipient.

1. A –> B: A
2. B –> A: R
3. A –> B: [R, E]<sub>A</sub> 🔔❕❗

**Solution 2.** If we’re using encryption for authentication (Needham-Schroeder Authentication protocol), enclose the sender’s ID.

1. A –> B: A
2. B –> A: {B, R}<sub>KP<sub>A</sub></sub>
3. A –> B: R

> The principle is to include both sender and receiver’s info in the protocol
>
> - When using encryption, sender’s id is included.
> - When using digital signature, receiver’s id is included

## Needham-Schroeder Secret key-based protocol

We saw the public key encryption protocol by NS, they also proposed a secret key **authentication** protocol. In this protocol, there are 3 parties: A (K<sub>SA</sub> – key given to A by server), B (K<sub>SB</sub> – key given to B by server), Server (K<sub>AB</sub> – session key that server provides to both A and B)

1. A &rarr; S: A, B, R<sub>A1</sub>
2. S &rarr; A: { R<sub>A1</sub>, B, { K<sub>AB</sub>, A }<sub>K<sub>SB </sub></sub>}<sub>K<sub>SA</sub></sub>
3. A &rarr; B: { K<sub>AB</sub>, A }<sub>K<sub>SB</sub></sub>, { R<sub>A2</sub> }<sub>K<sub>AB</sub></sub>
4. B &rarr; A: { R<sub>A2</sub> – 1, R<sub>B</sub>}<sub>K<sub>AB</sub></sub>
5. A &rarr; B: { R<sub>B</sub> – 1 }<sub>K<sub>AB</sub></sub>

> **Disadvantages.** Server needs to distribute secret key directly to B, and since B does not ask for a key, but receives one, if B is not responsive (AFK) or the server somehow can’t reach B then there will be no communication.

### Possible Attack

If E manages to obtain an old session key, K<sub>AB</sub>, E can replay the old message (step 3) relating to that session key. 

- If B completes the protocol and assumes that they shared a key with A, E would have tricked B.
- Can prevent this easily with timestamps.
